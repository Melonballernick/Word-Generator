# Word-Generator
A word generator that takes in a text document list and uses the information (phonemes, consonants, or vowels, and the frequency at which you'd like them to occur), and generates random words based on how long you want the word to be.
Run load("example") or load(whatever you name your list text file in quotes) and then run gen(length without quotations) and it should generate random words of that length. 
As shown in example.txt, the first item in your list should be your phoneme, followed by the percent frequency (1-100 not 0.01-1.00), followed by the type. The type decides how the code will restrain it through the res() (restraint) function. C = Consonant, V = Vowel, X = no restraint. If you want to design a language with consonant clusters, simply put each consonant cluster as a C type (same with diphthongs).
I can't remember, but I think the code only registers percent down to the ten-thousandth decimal or something like that? IDK. In general, it's pretty clunky because originally I was going to have the first line of each text file be dedicated to how to treat the restraints (whether you want to allow a vowel after another vowel so long as the first vowel was preceeded by a consonant as in English and other such rules) but I kinda just gave up and went, "F@#k it"
